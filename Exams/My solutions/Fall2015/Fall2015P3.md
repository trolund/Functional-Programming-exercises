## Problem 3 (35%)

We considerrivers, where a river has aname, a source contributing with anaverage streamflow rate(in Danish: ‘middelvandføring’) and a list of tributaries (in Danish: ‘bifloder’). A tributary is it self a river. We assume that names are unique for a river and will use the phrase ‘the rivern’ to mean ‘the river with namen’. Consider a simple example (where average stream flow rate is abbreviated to flow):


- A river named “R” has flow 10m3/s from its source and it has three tributaries named “R1”, “R2” and “R3”, respectively.
- The river “R1” has flow 5m3/s from its source and no tributaries.
- The river “R2” has flow 15m3/s from its source and one tributary named "R4".
- The river “R3” has flow 8m3/s from its source and no tributaries.
- The river “R4” has flow 2m3/s from its source and no tributaries.


The following F# types are used to model rivers with tributaries by trees:

```fsharp
type Name = string
type Flow = int    // can be assumed positive in below questions
type River = R of Name * Flow * Tributaries
and Tributaries = River list
```

##### 1. Declare F# values riv and riv3 corresponding to the rivers “R” and “R3”.

```fsharp
let riv3 = R("R3", 8, [])
let riv1 = R("R1", 5, [])
let riv4 = R("R4", 2, [])
let riv2 = R("R2", 15, [riv4])

let riv = R("R", 10, [riv1; riv2; riv3])
```

##### 2. Declare a function contains: Name → River → bool. The value of containsn ris true if and only if the name of r is n, or n is the name of a tributary occurring somewhere in r. For example, "R", "R1", "R2", "R3" and "R4" constitute all names contained in riv.

```fsharp
let rec triSearch n =
    function
    | [] -> false
    | head :: tail -> contains n head || triSearch n tail
and contains n =
    function
    | R (name, _, tri) when name = n -> true
    | R (_, _, tri) -> triSearch n tri
```

##### 3. Declare a function *allNames* *r* which returns a list with all names contained in the river *r*. The order in which names occur in the list is of no significance.

```fsharp
let rec nameSearch =
    function
    | [] -> []
    | head :: tail -> allNames head @ nameSearch tail
and allNames =
    function
    | R (name, _, tri) -> name :: nameSearch tri
```

##### 4. Declare a function *totalFlow* *r* which returns the total flow in the river mouth (inDanish ‘udmunding’) of *r*, by adding the flow from the source of *r* to the total flows of *r’s* tributaries. For example *totalFlow* riv = 40.

```fsharp
let rec subFlow =
    function
    | [] -> 0
    | head :: tail -> (totalFlow head) + (subFlow tail)
and totalFlow =
    function
    | R (_, flow, tri) -> flow + (subFlow tri)
```

##### 5.Declare a function *mainSource* : River → (Name ∗ Flow). If(n, f l) = mainSourcer, then *f* lis the biggest flow of some source occurring in the river *r* and *n* is the name of a river having this “biggest” source. For example, *mainSource* riv = ("R2",15) and *mainSource* riv3 = ("R3",8).

```fsharp
let mainSource r =

    let rec subSource =
        function
        | [] -> []
        | e :: es -> (source e) @ (subSource es)

    and source =
        function
        | R (name, flow, tri) -> (name, flow) :: (subSource tri)

    let folder acc elem =
        let (_, aFlow) = acc
        let (_, cFlow) = elem

        if cFlow > aFlow then elem else acc

    List.fold folder ("", 0) (source r)
```

##### 6. Declare a function *tryInsert* :Name → River → River → River option. The valueoftryInsertn t risSome *r′* if *n* is the name of a river inrandr′is obtained fromrby addingtas a tributary of *n*. The value of tryInsert *n* *t* *r* is None if *n* is not a name occurring in *r*.
