// Furthermore, t2 = t1 and t4 = t1 list due to b::... in (* 1 *) and x::... in (* 2 *)  
// The only constraint on t1 is that it must support equality. 
// Hence, most general type is: 'a -> 'a -> 'a list -> 'a list when 'a: equality

// Replace is not tail-recursive, because when the recursive call in (* 1 *) terminates,
