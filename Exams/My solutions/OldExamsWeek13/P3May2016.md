## Problem 3 from May 16 (approx 48 minutes)

We shall now consider containers that can either have the form of a tank, that is characterized by it length, width and height, or the form of a ball, that is characterized by its radius. This is captured by the following declaration:

```fsharp
type Container =
    | Tank of float * float * float // (length, width, height)
    | Ball of float                 // radius
```

##### 1. Declare two F# values of type *Container* for a tank and a ball, respectively.
