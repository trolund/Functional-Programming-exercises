### Problem 1 (30%)

```fsharp
type Appliance = string
type Usage = Appliance * int

let ad1 = ("washing machine", 2)
let ad2 = ("coffee machine", 1)
let ad3 = ("dishwasher", 2)
let ats = [ad1; ad2; ad3; ad1; ad2]
```

##### 1.Declare a function: inv: Usage list -> bool, that checks whether all time spansoccurring in a usage list are positive

```fsharp
let rec inv =
    function
    | [] -> true
    | head :: tail ->
        let (app, time) = head
        time >= 0 && inv tail
```

##### 2.Declare a function durationOf: Appliance -> Usage list -> int, where the valueofdurationOfaatsis the accumulated time span applianceais used in the listats.For example,durationOf "washing machine" atsshould be 4.


```fsharp
let durationOf (app: Appliance) (uts: Usage list) =
    let (_, resTime) =
        List.reduce (fun acc elem ->
            let (curApp, time) = elem
            let (app, accTime) = acc
            if curApp = app then (app, accTime + time) else (app, accTime)) uts

    resTime
```


##### 3. A usage list ats is well-formed if it satisfies inv and the accumulated time span of anyappliance inatsdoes not exceed 24. Declare a function that checks this well-formednesscondition.

```fsharp
let wellFormed ats =
    let sum =
        List.map (fun elem ->
            let (_, time) = elem
            time) ats

    List.reduce (fun acc x -> x + acc) sum
    <= 24
    && inv ats
```

##### 4. Declare a function delete(a,ats), where a is an appliance and ats is a usage list. The value ofdelete(a,ats) is the usage list obtained from ats by deletion of all us-ages ofa.  For example, deleting usage of the coffee machine from ats should give[ad1; ad3; ad1]. State the type of delete.


```fsharp
let delete (a, ats) = List.filter (fun x -> a <> x ) ats
```

We now consider thepriceof using appliances. This is based on atariffmapping anappliance to the price for one hourâ€™s usage of the appliance:

```fsharp
type Price  = int
type Tariff = Map<Appliance, Price>
```

##### 5. Declare a function is Definedats trf, where ats is a usage list and trf is a tariff. The value of is Defined ats trf is true if and only if there is an entry in trf for every applianceinats. State the type ofisDefined.

```fsharp
let rec isDefined ats trf =
    match ats with
    | [] -> true
    | head :: tail ->
        let (name, _) = head

        let check n =
            match Map.tryFind n trf with
            | Some (_) -> true
            | None -> false

        check name && isDefined tail trf
```

##### 6. Declare a function priceOf: Usage list -> Tariff -> Price, where the value of priceOf ats trf is the total price of using the appliances in ats. The function shouldraise a meaningful exception when an appliance is not defined in trf.

```fsharp
let priceOf ats trf =

    let rec sum ats acc =
        match ats with
        | [] -> acc
        | head :: tail ->
            let (name, hours) = head

            let check n =
                match Map.tryFind n trf with
                | Some (price) -> price
                | None -> failwith "En pris var ikke defineret"

            sum tail (check name + acc)

    sum ats 0
```
