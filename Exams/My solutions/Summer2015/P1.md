## Problem 1 (20%)

##### 1. Declare a function: repeat: string -> int -> string, so that repeats n builds a new string by repeating the string s altogether n times. For example: repeat "ab" 4="abababab" and repeat "ab" 0 = "".

```fsharp
let repeat s t =

    let rec loop acc n =
        match n with
        | 0 -> acc
        | _ -> s + loop acc (n - 1)

    loop "" t
```

##### 2. Declare a function f s1 s2 n that builds a string with n lines alternating between s1 and s2. For example:f "ab" "cd" 4 = "ab\ncd\nab\ncd" and f "XO" "OX" 3 = "XO\nOX\nXO". Note that\n is the escape sequence for the newline character.Give the type of the function.

```fsharp
