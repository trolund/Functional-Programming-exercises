## Problem 3 (40%)

We shall now consider family trees, also called trees of descendants, which give an overview of the descendants of a person, called the ancestor, in the form of a tree. The list of children of a person form the basis for the trees of descendants of that person. Information about persons, such as name,sex and year of birth, occurs in the nodes of the trees.

A family tree is shown in Figure 1, where the name of the ancestor is Larry, a male personborn in 1920. The children of Larry are May, Joe and Paul. Larry has five grandchildren

â€” one is Mary and she has three children.

Family trees are represented in F# as follows:

```fsharp
type Name = string
type Sex = | M              // male
           | F              // female

type YearOfBirth = int

type FamilyTree = P of Name * Sex * YearOfBirth * Children
and Children = FamilyTree list
```

The type for the sex is as in Problem 2. From now on we assume that the name of a person is unique in a family tree and that two persons in a family tree do not share children.

For F# representations of family trees we shall consider two properties:

1. Every person must be older than his/her children.

2. For every list of children, the siblings occur with decreasing ages so that the eldest occurs first and the youngest last.

A family tree satisfying these two properties is called well-formed.

##### 1. Declare a function *isWF: FamilyTree -> bool* that can check whether a family tree is well-formed.

 // contains n head || triSearch n tail

```fsharp
let rec isWFchildren lastCBith pb = function
    | [] -> true
    | child :: rest ->
        let (P (_, _, yofb, c)) = child
        pb < yofb
        && lastCBith < yofb
        && isWF child
        && isWFchildren yofb pb rest

and isWF = function
    | P (n, s, yofb, c) -> isWFchildren 0 yofb c
```

In the following questions you can assume that an argument (of type FamilyTree or typeChildren) to a function is well-formed. Furthermore, it is expected that the functions produce well-formed values (when they are of type FamilyTreeor type Children).

##### 2. Declare a function makePerson: Name*Sex*YearOfBith -> FamilyTree that can create a family tree for a child-less person on the basis of the name, sex and year of birth.

```fsharp
let makePerson (n, s, yofb) = P(n, s, yofb, [])
```

##### 3. Declare two mutually recursive functions:
