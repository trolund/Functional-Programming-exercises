##### 1. Give an evaluation (using ->) for f [1;6;0;8] [0; 7; 3; 3] thereby determining the value of this expression.

```fsharp
let rec f xs ys = 
    match (xs,ys) with
    | (x::xs1, y::ys1) -> x::y::f xs1 ys1
    | _ -> [];;
```

        f [1; 6; 0; 8] [0; 7; 3; 3]
    ->  1 :: 0 :: f [6; 0; 8] [7; 3; 3]
    ->  1 :: 0 :: 6 :: 7 :: f [0; 8] [3; 3]
    ->  1 :: 0 :: 6 :: 7 :: 0 :: 3 :: f [8] [3]
    ->  1 :: 0 :: 6 :: 7 :: 0 :: 3 :: 8 :: 3 :: f [] []
    ->  1 :: 0 :: 6 :: 7 :: 0 :: 3 :: 8 :: 3 :: []
    ->  1 :: 0 :: 6 :: 7 :: 0 :: 3 :: 8 :: [3]
    ->  1 :: 0 :: 6 :: 7 :: 0 :: 3 :: [8; 3]
    ->  1 :: 0 :: 6 :: 7 :: 0 :: [3; 8; 3]
    ->  1 :: 0 :: 6 :: 7 :: [0; 3; 8; 3]
    ->  1 :: 0 :: 6 :: [7; 0; 3; 8; 3]
    ->  1 :: 0 :: [6; 7; 0; 3; 8; 3]
    ->  1 :: [0; 6; 7; 0; 3; 8; 3]
    ->  [1; 0; 6; 7; 0; 3; 8; 3]


##### 2. Give the (most general) type for *f*,  and describe what *f* computes. Your descriptionshould focus on what it computes, rather than on individual computation steps.

    xs = 'a list
    yx = 'a list
    output = 'a list
    
    Resultat:
    'a list -> 'a list -> 'a list
    

##### 3. The declaration of *f* is not tail recursive.  Give a brief explanation of why this is the case and provide a declaration of a tail-recursive variant off that is based on an accumulating parameter. Your tail-recursive declaration must be based on an explicit recursion.

###### Brief explanation
    *f* er ikke tail da der tydeligt forgår arbejde efter det recusive kald og derfro skal stacken ikke holde den forående beregning helt frem til kaldende kolapser. 

###### Declaration of a tail-recursive variant

```fsharp
let rec f xs ys = 
    let rec loop acc = function 
        | (x::xs1, y::ys1) -> loop (x::y::acc) xs1 ys1
        | List.rev acc
    loop [] xs ys
```

##### 4. Provide a declaration of a continuation-based, tail-recursive variant off.

```fsharp
let rec f xs ys = 
    let rec loop cont = function 
        | (x::xs1, y::ys1) -> loop (fun acc -> cont (x::y::acc) ) xs1 ys1
        | _ -> cont []
    loop [] xs ys
```
