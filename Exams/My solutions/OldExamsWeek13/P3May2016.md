## Problem 3 from May 16 (approx 48 minutes)

We shall now consider containers that can either have the form of a tank, that is characterized by it length, width and height, or the form of a ball, that is characterized by its radius. This is captured by the following declaration:

```fsharp
type Container =
    | Tank of float * float * float // (length, width, height)
    | Ball of float                 // radius
```

##### 1. Declare two F# values of type *Container* for a tank and a ball, respectively.

```fsharp
    let t = Tank(2.0, 2.0, 2.0)
    let b = Ball(2.0)
```

##### 2. A tank is called well-formed when its length, width and height are all positive and a ballis well-formed when its radius is positive. Declare a function *isWF: Container → bool* that can test whether a container is well-formed.

```fsharp
let isWF = function
    | Tank (l, w, h) -> l > 0.0 && w > 0.0 && h > 0.0
    | Ball (r) -> r > 0.0
    | _ -> false
```

##### 3. Declare a function *volume c* computing the volume of a  container *c*. (Note that the volume of ball with radius *r* is 4/3·π·r^3.)

```fsharp
let volume = function
    | Tank (l, w, h) -> l * w * h
    | Ball (r) -> 3.0 / 4.0 * Math.PI * (r ** 3.0)
    | _ -> failwith "Not a container"
```
Acylinderis characterized by its radius and height, where both must  be positive float numbers.

##### 4. Extend the declaration of the type *Container* so that it also captures cylinders, and extend the functions *isWF * and *volume* accordingly. (Note that the volume of cylinder with radius *r* and height *h* is π·r^2·h.)

```fsharp
type Container =
    | Tank of float * float * float // (length, width, height)
    | Ball of float                 // radius
    | Cylinder of float * float     // radius, height


let volume = function
    | Tank (l, w, h) -> l * w * h
    | Ball (r) -> 3.0 / 4.0 * Math.PI * (r ** 3.0)
    | Cylinder(r, h) -> Math.PI * (r ** 2.0) * h 
    | _ -> failwith "Not a container"

let isWF = function
    | Tank(l,w,h) -> l > 0.0 && w > 0.0 && h > 0.0
    | Ball(r) -> r > 0.0
    | Cylinder(r, h) -> r > 0.0 && h > 0.0
    | _ -> false
```

Astorageconsist of a collection of uniquely named containers, each having a certaincon-tents, as modelled by the type declarations:

```fsharp
type Name     = string
type Contents = string
type Storage  = Map<Name, Contents*Container>
```

where the name and contents of containers are given as strings. Note:  You may choose to solve the below questions using a list-based model of a storage(type Storage = (Name * (Contents*Container)) list),  but  your  solutions  will,  inthat case, at most count 75%.

##### 5. Declare a value of type *Storage*, containing a tank with name "tank1" and contents "oil" and a ball with name "ball1" and contents "water".

```fsharp
let s = Map.ofList [("tank1", ("oil", Tank(2.0, 2.0, 2.0))); 
                    ("ball1", ("water", Ball(2.0)))]
```

##### 6. Declare a function *find: Name → Storage → Contents ∗ float*,  where *find n stg* should return the pair (cnt,vol) when *cnt* is the contents of a container with namenin storage *stg*, and *vol* is the volume of that container. A suitable exception must beraised when no container has namenin storagestg.

```fsharp (contents, container)
let find n stg =
    let item = Map.tryFind n stg

    match item with
    | Some (contents, container) ->
        let volume = volume container
        (contents, volume)
    | None -> failwith "Name does not exist"
```
