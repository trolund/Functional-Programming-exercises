## Problem 4 (30%)

The focus of this problem is on courses and curricula at DTU. Acourseis uniquely identified by acourse number and a course is described by a title and a number of ECTS point. The course base is a map from course numbers to course descriptions. This is captured by the following declarations:

```fsharp
type CourseNo   = int
type Title      = string
type ECTS       = int
type CourseDesc = Title * ECTS
type CourseBase = Map<CourseNo, CourseDesc>
```

We require in this problem that valid ECTS points are positive integers that are divisibleby 5, that is, 5, 10, 15, 20, ... is the sequence of valid ECTS points.


##### 1.Declare a function *isValid* CourseDesc: CourseDesc -> bool, where *isValid* CourseDesc desc is true if the ECTS part of desc is valid.

```fsharp
let isValidCourseDesc cd = 
    let (CourseDesc(title, ects)) = cd
    ects > 0 && ects % 5 = 0
```

##### 2.Declare a functionis *ValidCourseBase*: CourseBase -> bool, where *isValidCourseBase cb* is true if every course description occurring the coursebase *cb* is valid, that is, it satisfies the predicateisValidCourseDesc.

```fsharp
let isValidCourseBase cb = 
    Map.forall (fun cd -> isValidCourseDesc cd) cb
```
